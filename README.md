# Phenomena Coding Assignment

This is an interactive teaching tool about the linear function: y = mx + b. You can try it online [here](https://raw.githack.com/yichengxia/Phenomena-Coding-Assignment/main/index.html).

I implemented this by:

• presenting the function "y = mx + b" in a bold and large font;

• displaying a graph of the linear function in a (-30, 30) * (-30, 30) coordinate system, which can be cleared for any times;

• inputing and submitting the slope (m) and intercept (b) of the line with a button to instantly show the updated graph of the line.

I also implement some extra feature to improve the interactive experience of this teaching tool:

• showing the process of drawing a line, which can be replayed by simply clicking on the graph;

• marking the coordinates of intersection of the function, x-axis, and y-axis to indicate their relation with the values of m and b;

• showing the background grids and axis scales by default to clearify the shape of the line.
